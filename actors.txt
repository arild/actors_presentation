SCALA ACTORS
The most awesome thing ever?

Adressing problems with concurrency
- Shared states and locks


Actors = clerks with inboxes

Best practices
- Use only messages to communicate with an actor
- Actors should not block
- Prefer immutable messages
- Make messages self-contained
- Actors like bosses and minions

Akkar
"Todarodes sagittatus" er en tiarmet stimsv√∏mmende blekksprut
- Multiple tentacles get the jobs done!
- An Akkar has a highly complex nervous system, only part of which is localized in its brain.
- Two-thirds of an octopus's neurons are found in the nerve cords of its arms, which have limited functional autonomy.
- Octopus arms show a variety of complex reflex actions that persist even when they have no input from the brain.

Akka
- The digital Akkar (also Actor Kernel palindrome..)
- Toolkit & Runtime for building concurrent, distributed and fault-tolerant event-driven apps on the JVM
- Scala and Java version
- Concurrency through akka.Actor
- Distribution through Remoting
- Fault-Tolerance through supervision
